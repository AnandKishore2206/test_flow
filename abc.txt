Working with you has been an absolute privilege. You've always been so affirmative, clear in your communication, and incredibly strong in your decisions. Your deep domain knowledge and sharp memory have amazed me more times than I can count. You have this rare ability to take on a huge amount of work and still keep everything aligned toward our common goals — it's been truly inspiring."

"Your insights have always added so much value to our discussions, and your presence will definitely be missed. It’s hard to see you go, but I’m sure your next project is lucky to have you. Wishing you all the best on your new journey!"
