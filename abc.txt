"AI-Powered JIRA Quality and Impact Analysis Assistant"

ðŸ“˜ Project Description
The project aims to build an AI-driven assistant that evaluates the quality of JIRA user stories using defined parameters (like clarity, completeness, acceptance criteria, dependencies, etc.) and leverages LLMs and ML models trained on historical JIRA data. Additionally, it analyzes historical JIRA stories and associated code commits to perform intelligent impact analysis whenever a new JIRA is created. It suggests potentially impacted modules/files and recommends areas where code changes may be required.
