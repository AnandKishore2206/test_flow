This year, I took a leading role in the critical areas of budget estimations, cost and resource planning, and both yearly and quarterly planning. I was heavily involved in providing T-shirt-sized estimations, Epic-level estimations, and granular story-level assessments. By working closely with the product team, I helped them prioritize their backlog more effectively, ensuring that high-impact work aligned with our capacity and strategic goals. My collaboration extended to the program team, where I contributed to capacity planning, allowing for optimal resource allocation. Additionally, I supported the tech team by helping to plan and align design and development efforts, significantly reducing the time spent on revisions and rework. This collaborative effort has saved the entire team a tremendous amount of time and effort, streamlining processes and contributing to smoother execution.

As part of my responsibilities, I conducted deep-dive analyses on high-level line items provided by the product team for upcoming work, whether for the next quarter or next year. I meticulously evaluated how this work would impact existing features, performing thorough impact analyses to assess any potential challenges or design considerations. I identified the necessary technologies, pinpointed assumptions, and flagged risks associated with each line item. By estimating the level of effort involved at both a high and detailed level, I facilitated more accurate capacity planning and helped our team anticipate workload demands. This deep analysis provided the basis for splitting high-level work into more manageable stories and generating story-level estimations based on key factors such as design complexity, integration points, dependency mapping, and the technical depth of features.

Through this process, I also simplified the story refinement process for the Product Owner (PO) team, enabling them to plan their work and set priorities ahead of time, based on reliable estimates and a clear understanding of capacity. This groundwork was invaluable for the program team as they mapped resources and planned work in line with agile methodologies. My contributions ensured that both long-term strategic planning and day-to-day sprint execution were aligned, improving overall efficiency, reducing bottlenecks, and helping teams meet deadlines with greater precision. Ultimately, my efforts contributed to a more structured and well-coordinated planning process, benefiting not only the development teams but also stakeholders across the program.
