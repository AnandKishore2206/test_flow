Slide 1: Problem Statement
Challenges with Manual Test Case Conversion
Time-Consuming: Manually converting test cases from QTest to Cucumber files is labor-intensive.
Prone to Errors: Manual processes increase the likelihood of mistakes, leading to inconsistent test coverage.
Lack of Standardization: Different teams may use varying formats, causing discrepancies in test case documentation.
Inefficiency: Redundant tasks waste resources and slow down the testing and development cycles.
Scalability Issues: Manual conversion does not scale well with growing test suites and complex projects.
