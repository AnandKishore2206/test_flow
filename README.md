 Keep Admin Features in Angular, Build a Separate React App for Users
How it works:

Maintain the existing Angular app for admin-related pages.
Build a new React app for user-facing pages with Salt UI.
Host them separately and link between them as needed.
Pros: ✅ Simple to implement.
✅ Clear separation of concerns.
✅ No need to force React inside the Angular app.
✅ Can gradually migrate admin pages later if needed.

Cons: ❌ Requires authentication/session management across two apps.
❌ Context switching between two different apps.

Best for: If the admin app doesn't need major enhancements anytime soon.

2️⃣ Use a Micro Frontend Approach (Single SPA or Module Federation)
How it works:

Use Single-SPA or Webpack Module Federation to host both Angular and React apps under one shell.
Based on the route, load either Angular components (for admin pages) or React components (for user pages).
Example:
/admin/* → Load Angular app
/user/* → Load React app
Pros: ✅ Single application for both admin and user pages.
✅ Can progressively migrate features from Angular to React.
✅ Seamless navigation between pages.
✅ Easier to manage shared states like authentication.

Cons: ❌ Additional complexity in setting up micro frontends.
❌ Initial performance cost due to loading multiple frameworks.

Best for: If you want a seamless user experience without two separate apps.

3️⃣ Embed React into the Angular App Using Angular Elements
How it works:

Use React inside Angular via Angular Elements.
Keep Angular as the shell, but embed React components inside it.
Convert React components to Web Components and use them inside Angular.
Pros: ✅ No need to create a new app.
✅ Can migrate page by page without breaking the Angular app.
✅ Easier for teams who are still learning React.

Cons: ❌ Might be harder to integrate Salt UI since Angular still controls the app.
❌ Some communication issues between Angular and React components.

Best for: If you want to introduce React gradually inside Angular.

4️⃣ Rewrite Everything in React and Gradually Decommission Angular
How it works:

Start building everything in React from scratch.
Keep a temporary bridge for admin pages until they are migrated.
Once migration is complete, fully remove Angular.
Pros: ✅ Future-proof and aligns with the firmwide React decision.
✅ No need to maintain two frameworks.
✅ Can leverage modern tech stack fully.

Cons: ❌ Requires significant effort and budget.
❌ Need to reimplement admin features in React at some point.
❌ No quick transition—it’s a full migration.

Best for: If you can get buy-in for a full migration.

🔥 Recommended Approach Based on Your Case
Since you must keep admin pages in Angular due to budget constraints and still want to move to React, the best option is:
✅ Option 2 (Micro Frontend with Single-SPA/Module Federation)
This will let you:
✔ Keep the Angular admin pages untouched.
✔ Build user pages in React as a separate micro frontend.
✔ Avoid duplicating authentication and session handling.
✔ Eventually migrate admin pages when you get the budget.
